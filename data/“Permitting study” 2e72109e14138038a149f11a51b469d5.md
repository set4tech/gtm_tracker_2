Hi Troy,

Many cities leaders are exploring the potential of AI in permitting, to improve cycle time.

Is City of Culver City exploring permitting improvements, and where AI can help?

If so, my team is running simple permit studies, where AI is used in parallel with current permit processes. This gives a give a safe, no-cost way to compare AI to your current workflow.

We're building an AI permitting solution, with early partners such as City of Knoxville and County of Merced. We're backed by Emergent Ventures, and launching in Q2 this year.

If that sounds relevant, happy to explore on a short introductory call when best.

Many thanks,

Ed
